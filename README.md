Take on the role of a cunning vizier in this narrative-driven game with card-based mechanics. Inspired by the enchanting tales of One Thousand and One Nights, you'll face courtly intrigue, treacherous choices, and deadly puzzles as you serve a powerful and unpredictable Sultan.

This simplified version was adapted from Sultan's Game (Double Cross) and developed solo, with love and ambition. While it may be modest in scope, 

the story runs deep â€” and your fate lies in the cards.

Can you survive the Mini Sultan's Game?
